Internet-Draft              https-notif-cbor                   July 2025


1.  Introduction

   This document introduces a CBOR encoding scheme for event
   notifications over HTTPS by using the framework proposed in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif-15] which supports transfer of
   YANG notifications over HTTPS using JSON and XML encoding schemes.

   In [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif-15], the capabilities HTTP-
   target resource allows a publisher to retrieve supported encoding
   formats via a GET request, while the relay-notification resource
   enables the publisher to send YANG notifications via POST requests.
   These requests and responses use different content types based on the
   selected encoding scheme.  This document defines support for using
   CBOR encoding as mentioned in section 1 of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif-15]

   CBOR offers an efficient and compact representation of YANG
   notifications.

   Examples of the GET and POST request and reply encoded in CBOR are
   also provided.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms defined in Section 2,3 and 4
   of [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif-15]:

   *  Capabilities Resource

   *  Relay-Notification

   *  Event Notification

   The following term(s) are defined in Subscription to YANG
   Notifications [RFC8639]:

   *  Publisher

   *  Receiver

Internet-Draft              https-notif-cbor                   July 2025


   *  Subscribed Notifications

   The following term(s) are defined in Encoding of Data Modeled with
   YANG in the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) [RFC9254]:

   *  Diagnostic Notifications

   *  YANG Schema Item iDentifier (or "YANG SID" or simply "SID"):
      63-bit unsigned integer used to identify different YANG items.

4.  CBOR Encoding of the notification(s)

   YANG notifications can be encoded in CBOR using Names or SIDs in
   keys.  Notifications encoded using names is similar to JSON encoding
   as defined in Section 3.4 and 4.3 of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif-15].  Notification encoded using
   YANG-SIDs replaces the names of the keys of the CBOR encoded message
   with a 63 bit unsigned integer.  In this case, the term 'SID' is
   defined in Section 3.2 of [RFC9254], and the keys of the encoded data
   use SID value as mentioned in 4.3.2 of this document.

4.1.  Capabilities Request

   The publisher sends a request to the receiver to learn its
   capabilities.  In the below example, the “Accept” states that the
   publisher wants to receive the capabilities response in CBOR but if
   not supported then in XML or JSON in that order.

   GET /some/path/capabilities HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Accept: application/cbor, application/xml;0.9, application/json;q=0.5

4.2.  Capabilities Response

   If the receiver is able to reply using “application/cbor” and
   assuming it is capable of receiving JSON, XML and CBOR encoded
   messages the response would look like this

4.2.1.  CBOR using names as keys

4.4.  Relay Notification Response

   The response on success is "204 (No Content)".  In case of corrupted
   or malformed event, the response is an appropriate HTTP error
   response.

5.  Scope of Experimentation

   CBOR encoding may be tested against JSON and XML to evaluate requests
   per second, data transfer rate, and overall network efficiency.

   Bandwidth constraints can be applied using traffic control to analyze
   CBOR encoding efficiency under different network conditions.

6.  Security Considerations

   Addition of the CBOR encoding introduces no specific security
   exposures or risks other that the ones mentioned in [RFC9254] and
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif-15] (An HTTPS-based Transport for
   YANG Notifications)
